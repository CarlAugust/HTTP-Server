Documentation for how to use the http server

The server currently uses a one request one response close method for communication,
this should perhaps be changed to be done by multithreading such that the connection can be kept alive.

The server folder is the main application of the server.
Inside the public folder you can put your html, css and js and it will be treated as the root /.

sendFile() sends the file requested by the client, and index.html if its empty.
