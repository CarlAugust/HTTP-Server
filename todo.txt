What i plan on doing, i guess?

1. Implement a routing system. Perhaps some sort of map so that i can search with keys
and some system to add specific functions to the routes, including middleware. 

2. Make base http response function, such as redirect, send file (it should automatically open the index file in a folder)

3. Everytime the client sends a response the client_fd gets closed
This might be proper implementation but i will have to research it.

4. Adress server security, research about security and try to find security flaws within the server

5. I want to see if i can make the application work with htmx
