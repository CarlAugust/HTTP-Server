List of things that need to be done:
ordering really does not matter that much

1. fix threads such that it stores threads dynamically and removes not running threads

1,9. Proper error responses for the later parsing, nad implementil connection:keep-alive/close, and
timeout to close threads
2. Proper parsing of requests, being able to differtiate from /home or /home?id=23,
both are same path however one has a parameter

3. The router such that i can define different routes and what they do, with method path and params, 1/3 still have to implement other routing features like params ect...

4. The ability to send over different formats such as json or images.

5. Support for more headers on both request and response
